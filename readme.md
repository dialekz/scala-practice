# Scala Practice Project

The project presents simple steps of touching several technologies for programming with scala language. There will be texted some notes of these steps.

## Step 1 : Scala with cats

Exercises from the book [Scala with cats](https://www.scalawithcats.com/dist/scala-with-cats.pdf). Can see solutions in the package *module.scala_with_cats*.

## Step 2 : Quill

Going throw [getquill.io](https://getquill.io/) documentation. Package *module.quill_practice*.  
Had some troubles with configuration using H2 (enough for practice) - thanks [h2db-quill-demo](https://github.com/Neurodyne/h2db-quill-demo) for a nice demonstrate example.
